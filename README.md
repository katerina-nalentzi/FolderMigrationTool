# FolderMigrationTool
A simple python script that automates the process of copying specific directories from a source to a destination directory based on a list of folder names provided in a text file. It is designed to facilitate selective folder synchronisation, for backing up, replicating, or transferring specific data sets efficiently.


## Features

- **Selective Copying**: Only copies folders listed in the provided text file.
- **Non-Destructive**: Skips the copying process for folders that already exist at the destination, preventing data overwriting.
- **Automation**: Streamlines batch processing of folder copying tasks, suitable for backups or data migration.
